$(".comments").prepend("<%= j render 'comment', com: @comment %>");
// $("#comment_body").val("");

<%# we need to re-instantiate the @comment variable in here becuase the @comment
    variable references a record that has already been created in the database
    so the form will use PATCH and submit to the update action. We want the
    form to submit to the create action %>
<% @comment = Comment.new %>
$("#new_comment").replaceWith("<%= j render 'form' %>");
